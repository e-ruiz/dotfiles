# Tint2

 
*from man pages:*
Tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar made for modern X window managers. 
It was specifically made for Openbox but it should also work with other window managers (GNOME, KDE, XFCE etc.).

Tint2 was written by Thierry Lorthiois ⟨lorthiois@bbsoft.fr⟩. 
It is based on ttm, originally written by Pål Staurland ⟨staura@gmail.com⟩.

This manual page was originally written by Daniel Moerner ⟨dmoerner@gmail.com⟩, 
for the Debian project (but may be used by others). 
It was adopted from the tint2 docs.
